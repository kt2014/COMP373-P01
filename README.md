## **COMP 373/473 - Objects, Frameworks, and Patterns - Project 1
## **Facility Management System**



**To Run:** Run FacilityClient in COMP373-P01\src\view\FacilityClient.java


**Project Description:**

In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by addressing the design and implementation using OOP. The aim is to have a domain model that is designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency.

**System Description:**

Facilities are the building units (buildings and rooms inside) that a company
uses to support the activities of the business. This system will support the management of buildings,
their constant use, and maintenance support when it is needed. The following are the three main
functionalities of this system:

**1. Facility and its description** - this will cover the functionalities such as adding a new facility to
be managed; removing a facility from being managed; getting general information such as
the number and capacity of facilities and their current statuses.

**2. Facility use** – this covers the functionalities of managing the facility such as reserving a
facility; the cost of using and maintaining it; assigning and de-assigning a facility for use.

**3. Facility maintenance** – this functionality covers the maintenance of a facility such as
scheduling a facility for maintenance; checking maintenance status; listing maintenance
requests; calculating down time of a facility and many more functionalities.
